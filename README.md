# SpaceEngine
My Project to create a Game. It contains the Engine of my Game and depends upon the SpaceUtils-Project. This requires certain structures and initialization, so it is difficult to use if you want to make your own engine from the ground up, but if you want to just make a game or want to have most stuff premade, just want to add some more stuff specific to your game, this works for you. It is designed to be highly modular, so customization and only partial usage is entirely possible.
